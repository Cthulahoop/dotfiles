#   directory
#   symbolic link
#   socket
#   pipe
#   executable
#   block special
#   character special
#   executable with setuid bit set

# They are set in pairs, foreground (f) then background (b),
# i.e. fbfbfbfbfbfbfbfbfbfbfb for all 11 settings.
# The default is exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad, i.e. blue foreground and
# default background for regular directories,
# black foreground and red background for setuid executables, etc.
